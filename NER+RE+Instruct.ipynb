In the event that a potential change or extra work is recognized, General Contractor will request the Subcontractor to submit a proposal, which Subcontractor shall provide within five 5 days of the General Contractors request, unless extended by mutual written agreement. Subcontractor shall not proceed with a change or extra work unless it first has a specific Potential Change Item PCI control number issued by the General Contractor. Without this specific PCI control number any change or extra work will NOT be compensated, regardless of merit. The proposal must reference this specific PCI control number in order to be reviewed. The proposal shall include a breakdown which includes quantities of various materials, hours of labor required with respect to each class of work, items subcontracted, and individual line items for overhead and profit. Deductions in work scope to be priced similarly to additions. Lump sum pricing for changes or extra work without a breakdown will NOT be accepted. Failure to provide pricing within the required timeframe will be the Subcontractors agreement of no additional cost or time for the change or extra work. If the proposed change or extra work has any time impact in the opinion of the Subcontractor, the Subcontractor shall include a time extension request with substantiation in the Subcontractors proposal, or it will be conclusively agreed that there are no such schedule-related impacts. In the event the Subcontractor performs authorized work as directed by General Contractor on a time and materials TM basis, Subcontractor shall furnish to the General Contractor on a daily basis all timesheets, material tickets, and listing of any other items for which compensation is requested for General Contractors review and approval. All items must be listed on the document at the time of General Contractors signature. Signed TM documents do not constitute an approved change order. They are only verification of the work. Copies of these signed documents must be included as back-up for the change order request, which must be submitted no later than five 5 days after the conclusion of the TM work. Any costs not submitted for approval pursuant to these requirements will not be compensated. In the event General Contractor and Subcontractor cannot agree on whether or not the work is changed or extra work, or on the value of or time impact as a result of changed or extra work, or if Subcontractor is directed to proceed with changed or extra work prior to issuance of a change order, Subcontractor shall proceed with and timely prosecute the work as directed by General Contractor. Upon receipt of this direction, the Subcontractor shall diligently perform the work without disruption or delay. Disputes will be resolved pursuant to this Agreement. Unless otherwise provided in the Prime Contract, the Subcontractors mark-up for overhead and profit on changed or extra work performed shall not exceed those indicated in the Work Order. Labor rates used must be justified, including a detailed breakdown of burden, benefits, insurance, and payroll taxes. Subcontractor agrees to give General Contractor access to his certified payroll records to confirm actual pay rates. By executing a Change Order, Subcontractor agrees that the compensation in both time and amount is in full, and is inclusive of any inefficiency, delays, extended overhead, lost productivity, or any other direct or indirect impacts. Failure to promptly return no later than 14 days from the date of issuance the executed Subcontract Change Order may result in withholding of progress payments for the changed work, at the General Contractors sole discretion. In the event that General Contractor directs Subcontractor to work overtime at the General Contractors expense, Subcontractor agrees to perform such work and shall be reimbursed only for the difference between regular time and overtime rates and the related payroll taxes, insurance, and benefits. Subcontractor shall not be compensated for inefficiencies or declines in productivity. Nothing herein shall be construed to obligate General Contractor to pay for any overtime work if it has not been approved in writing, or for any overtime work caused by the failure of Subcontractor to provide sufficient manpower or otherwise maintain the progress of the work. In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim for additional compensation or time extension, Subcontractor shall provide the General Contractor with written notice no later than five 5 days from the occurrence of the event on which the claim is made. Such notice shall include but not be limited to a statement of the extent of the time extension and additional compensation requested along with detailed support. Such notice shall describe the claim in detail so as to allow General Contractor to fully evaluate its merits. Any claim not presented within stated time period shall be considered waived by Subcontractor. In the event that a change is made or extra work is required by the Owner or its agents, and the resulting Subcontractors change request meets the merit and timeliness requirement set forth in the Prime Contract, the General Contractor will present it to the Owner. The decision of the Owner shall be final and binding upon the Subcontractor to the same extent that it is final and binding on the General Contractor. No claims for additional compensation or damages for delays, whether caused in whole or in part by any conduct on the part of General Contractor, including, but not limited to, conduct amounting to a breach of the Subcontract, or delays by other subcontractors or Owner, shall be recoverable from General Contractor, and the extension of time for completion of Subcontractors work shall be the sole remedy available to Subcontractor; provided, however, that in the event General Contractor obtains additional compensation from Owner on account of delays for which Subcontractor has made a claim in compliance with the requirements of the Subcontract, Subcontractor shall be entitled to such portion of the additional compensation so received by General Contractor from Owner as is equitable under the circumstances. In the event that General Contractor prosecutes a claim against Owner for additional compensation for any delay which includes a pass-through delay claim by Subcontractor, Subcontractor shall cooperate fully with General Contractor in the prosecution thereof and shall pay costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith. Nothing herein shall require the General Contractor to pursue a pass-through delay claim by Subcontractor, which determination shall be made in General Contractors sole discretion. Subcontractor cannot submit a payment request for changed or extra work until a Change Order for the work has been executed by the General Contractor and Subcontractor.

FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n","  torch.load(os.path.join(input_path, \"pytorch_model.bin\"), map_location=torch.device(\"cpu\"))\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Detailed summary saved to: /content/new_contract_summary_structured_detailed_mpnet_concise.txt\n"]}]}]}
