Subcontractor shall participate in weekly and other periodic jobsite meetings that involve scheduling, review of upcoming work activities and sequences, and comply with progress and look-ahead schedules prepared by the General Contractor.

Final payment, including retention release shall be governed by the terms of the Prime Contract. However, under no circumstances shall final payment be made prior to Subcontractor completing all applicable Subcontract requirements including completion of punchlist, submission of as-builts, OM manuals and warrantees, furnishing of spare parts, keys, attic stock, and the completion of training. No payment under this Agreement shall be evidence of the performance of Work, either wholly or in part, and no payment shall be construed to be an acceptance of defective work or improper materials. In the event any person or party furnishing labor or materials to Subcontractor files a mechanics lien or stop notice, Subcontractor is obligated to promptly take all necessary steps to have such mechanics lien or stop notice withdrawn, including the posting of a release bond. In the event that the Subcontractor fails to have the mechanics lien or stop notice removed or bonded over within five 5 days, the General Contractor may take all necessary actions which it deems reasonable or necessary to cause the mechanics lien or stop notice to be released. All costs associated with the General Contractors actions, including the cost of any bond and any legal costs or attorneys fees, shall be deducted from amounts payable to Subcontractor. Subcontractor shall remain liable in the event that monies payable to it are insufficient to pay any expenses or damages arising from such mechanics liens or stop notices. The Subcontractors full and faithful performance of all obligations under this Agreement is a condition precedent to Subcontractors right to receive payment for the work performed. The Subcontractor acknowledges and agrees that the above procedures are the minimum conditions which shall be met prior to any payment, partial or final, becoming due. In addition, the Subcontractor agrees that if the Prime Contract requires additional procedures supplementing the minimum procedures above, the Subcontractor shall also comply with such supplemental procedures and these also are a condition precedent to General Contractors obligation to issue payment to the Subcontractor, and no payment shall become due unless and until such conditions are satisfied. MASTER SUBCONTRACT AGREEMENT Page 14 of PMSC07_110 Rev. Aug 2017 15 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 1. In addition to the work required in the Subcontract Agreement, and in the event the Work Order requires Subcontractor to perform design-build work, then this Article is applicable. General Contractor retains Subcontractor to provide all design services necessary or incidental to complete Subcontractors portions of the Work, in accordance with and reasonably inferable from that which is indicated in the Subcontract Documents, and consistent with the progress schedule prepared by General Contractor. Subcontractor agrees to perform such design work under the general direction of General Contractor and subject to the final approval of General Contractor, Owner and the Owners Architect andor Engineer. Design services provided by Subcontractor shall be procured from licensed design professionals retained by Subcontractor or furnished by licensed employees of Subcontractor. The standard of care for design services performed under this Agreement shall be the care and skill ordinarily used by members of the architectural and engineering professions practicing under similar conditions at the same time and locality. The persons or entitys providing design services for Subcontractor shall be referred to as the Designer. If the Designer is an independent professional, the design services shall be procured pursuant to a separate agreement between Subcontractor and the Designer. Subcontractor shall notify General Contractor in writing if it intends to change the Designer, which shall be subject to General Contractors approval. The Subcontractor shall be responsible for coordinating its design with all other elements of the Project design. Subcontractor shall furnish its best skill and judgment in the performance of the Subcontract and shall perform its design work to the satisfaction of General Contractor, the Owner and the ArchitectEngineer, so that General Contractor may fulfill its obligations to the Owner. Subcontractor shall be responsible for taking field dimensions, providing tests, providing certifications and obtaining required permits as required to meet Subcontractors design services. Subcontractor will coordinate with the ArchitectEngineer, General Contractor, and General Contractors other subcontractors, in designing its portion of the work to avoid inconsistencies and conflict in design. Subcontractor will not be entitled to a change order for additional work required due to i failure to coordinate its design with the work of others; ii errors or omissions by Subcontractor or the Designer in preparing construction documents related to its Work; or iii omission of construction work that was required by, or reasonably inferable from, the Subcontractors design or the Project design. In addition to other warranties provided in the Subcontract Agreement, Subcontractor warrants that its design will meet or exceed any performance requirements set forth in the Contract Documents. Ownership of Documents. Upon payment to the Subcontractor pursuant to the Subcontract, General Contractor shall receive ownership of the documents, drawings, specifications, electronic data and information prepared, provided or procured by the Subcontractor, any of its subcontractors, or the Designer for the Project Design-Build Documents. If provided in the Owner-General Contractor Agreement, the Owner shall receive from the General Contractor the same ownership of property rights of the Design-Build Documents, as the General Contractor received from the Subcontractor, in accordance with ownership of documents provisions of the Owner- General Contractor Agreement. In accordance with the Owner-General Contractor Agreement, the Owner may use, reproduce or make derivative works from the Design-Build Documents for subsequent renovation and remodeling of the Work, but shall not use, reproduce or make derivative works from the Design- Build Documents for other projects without the written authorization of the General Contractor and Subcontractor. Similarly, Subcontractor shall obtain from its Designer property rights and rights of use that correspond to the provisions herein. Professional Liability Insurance. In addition to the insurance required by the Subcontract, Subcontractor at its sole cost will purchase and maintain professional liability insurance with limits of at least 2,000,000 per claim and in the aggregate, and a deductible of no more than 100,000. This coverage must include an extended reporting period extending for at least three years after the date of Substantial Completion of the Work as a whole. Subcontractor must provide written confirmation at least once a year that this coverage remains in effect, during the entire period for which coverage is required. The policy must be endorsed or otherwise confirmed to cover the errors and omissions of the Designer, all subconsultants, subcontractors or contract employees of the Subcontractor who carry out professional design or engineering services required by this Subcontract Agreement, as well as those of the Subcontractor itself. The policy shall bear a retroactive date adequate to cover all professional services rendered for the Work, whether actually performed before or after this Subcontract is executed. A Certificate of Insurance must be submitted prior to the commencement of design services, and thereafter upon reasonable request by General Contractor. The coverage of such policies shall not be subject to declining limits for the costs of defense. This Subcontract as defined herein constitutes the entire agreement between General Contractor and Subcontractor. This Agreement may not be changed or modified in any way except as herein provided, and no term or condition of the Subcontract Documents shall be waived or modified by the General Contractor except in writing and signed by an officer of the General Contractor.
